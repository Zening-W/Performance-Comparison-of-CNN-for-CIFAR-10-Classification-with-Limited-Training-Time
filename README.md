# Performance-Comparison-of-CNN-for-CIFAR-10-Classification-with-Limited-Training-Time
This the final class proejct of COGS 181
This report presents an empirical study on various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and hyperparameters for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset with limited training time. Something new of this study is that the training time is limited to 10 epochs, mimicking real-world scenarios where rapid model development and deployment are essential. The study delves into the impact of different network architectures, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameter settings on the accuracy and training efficiency of the models. Through a series of experiments involving baseline CNN models, custom architectures, and established architectures like AlexNet and LeNet, we assess the effectiveness of each approach and provide insights into the factors influencing model performance. We also discuss the difference in accuracy between each different class in CIFAR-10 dataset and try to gain a deeper understanding of model behavior.
